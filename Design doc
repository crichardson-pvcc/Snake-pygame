Pygame design doc 

1 Goal

    Learn how to use pygame (we just learned it in class)

    Practice loops and if statments

    Work with events and real time input

    Try to make a fun working game that ends when u lose

2 How It Works

    Snake moves with the arrow keys

    Food shows up in a random spot

    When snake hits food, it grows

    If you hit the wall or yourself its game over

    Score goes up by 1 for each food

3 Game Parts

    Snake: made of blocks that follow each other (a list of coords)

    Food: red square that shows in random place

    Screen: the game window, 600 x 400 size

    Score: text in corner shows how many food eaten

4 Controls

    UP arrow – go up

    DOWN – go down

    LEFT – go left

    RIGHT – go right

    ESC – quit the game

5 Game Loop

    Set up everything (snake, food, screen)

    Start loop:

        check key presses

        move the snake

        check if it ate food

        check if it hit wall or body

        draw all stuff on screen

        wait a bit (control speed)

    End if crash, show game over message

6 Functions (planed)

    gameLoop – runs the whole game

    draw_snake – shows the snake on screen

    message – shows game over or stuff

    your_score – shows score on the top

    random_food – make food in random spot
